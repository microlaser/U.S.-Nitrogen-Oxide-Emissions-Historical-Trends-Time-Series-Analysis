Scientific Summary of NOx/NOy Emission Analysis

This project presents a data-driven analysis of historical nitrogen oxides (NOx/NOy) emissions trends in the United States, utilizing publicly available air quality data. The primary objective was to investigate the influence of both a continuous secular time trend and presidential political party affiliation on pollutant concentrations.

Methodology

The analysis employed a two-part statistical approach:

    Multivariate Regression Analysis: A multivariate ordinary least squares (OLS) regression model was constructed to assess the relationship between NOx/NOy concentrations, a continuous time variable, and a binary political party variable (Republican vs. Democrat). This approach was chosen to isolate the effect of political party after accounting for the powerful confounding variable of time, which represents a multitude of factors like regulatory changes and technological advancements.

    ARIMA Time Series Forecasting: A party-neutral ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model was applied to the aggregated yearly data to forecast future NOx/NOy concentrations based on past trends, providing a projection of the long-term trajectory.

Key Findings

The statistical models yielded two primary conclusions:

    Dominant Secular Trend: The regression analysis revealed a strong and statistically significant negative secular trend in NOx/NOy emissions. This indicates that the primary driver of air quality improvement has been a consistent, long-term decrease in pollutant levels over time, independent of short-term political cycles.

    Statistically Significant Party Correlation: After controlling for the dominant time trend, the regression model found a statistically significant correlation between presidential party and pollutant concentrations. The results indicate that Republican administrations were associated with higher average NOx/NOy levels when compared to Democratic administrations at any given point in time.

The ARIMA forecast further supported these findings by projecting that the long-term negative trend in NOx/NOy concentrations will continue into the future.

Conclusion

The project's findings demonstrate that while a powerful, bipartisan secular trend is the main driver of NOx/NOy emission reduction, a statistically significant correlation with political party exists after controlling for this trend. This analysis highlights the importance of using robust statistical methods to disentangle multiple causal factors in complex environmental datasets.
